Of course. Here is a comprehensive markdown file, `FEATURES.md`, that documents the features computed by your pipeline. It explains the timestamping convention, naming scheme, and the calculation logic for each feature, as requested. This file can be placed in the root of your `quantitative_feature_pipeline` project for easy reference.

# Feature Pipeline Documentation (`FEATURES.md`)

## 1. Overview

This document provides a comprehensive reference for the features generated by the quantitative feature pipeline. It is intended for data scientists, researchers, and developers who will be consuming the final output dataframes for model training, backtesting, or analysis.

The pipeline processes high-frequency raw market data (trades and quotes) for a variety of instruments (ETFs, Futures, Options) and produces a rich set of engineered features at multiple time granularities (e.g., 30s, 60s, 120s, 300s).

## 2. Core Concepts

Before diving into the specific features, it's essential to understand these core concepts.

### Timestamp (`ts_event`)

The `ts_event` column is the primary timestamp index for all aggregated feature dataframes. It represents the **start of the time interval** (the "open" of the bar). The intervals are left-closed and right-open.

-   **Example:** For a `30s` interval, a `ts_event` of `2025-03-19 09:30:00.000` represents the aggregation of all raw data that occurred from `09:30:00.000` up to (but not including) `09:30:30.000`.

### Naming Convention

All feature columns follow a standardized naming convention to ensure clarity and avoid ambiguity:

`[FeatureName]_[Interval]_[InstrumentSuffix]`

-   **`[FeatureName]`**: The base name of the feature (e.g., `realized_vol`, `net_gamma_flow`).
-   **`[Interval]`**: The aggregation interval in seconds (e.g., `30s`, `60s`).
-   **`[InstrumentSuffix]`**: The suffix of the instrument the feature was calculated for (e.g., `_spy`, `_qqq`, `_spxw`).

**Example:** `realized_vol_30s_spy` is the realized volatility for SPY, calculated over a 30-second interval.

### Raw Data Granularity (OHLCV)

The raw data for futures instruments (`_mes`, `_mnq`) is provided as 1-second OHLCV bars. When these are used for feature calculation:
-   The **`close`** price of the 1-second bar is treated as the primary `price` for that second.
-   The **`volume`** of the 1-second bar is treated as the `size` for that second.
-   Bid/Ask prices for futures are proxied using the `close` price and the configured `tick_size` if available.

## 3. Feature Categories

### I. Core Market Microstructure Features (Single-Asset)

These features are calculated for each individual underlying asset (ETFs and Futures).

| `signed_volume`         | `signed_volume_30s_spy`            | The sum of trade volumes, signed based on trade price relative to the prevailing bid/ask spread (Lee-Ready algorithm).

### IV. Machine Learning & Fused Features

These features are generated by neural network models and represent learned, compressed representations of the market state.

| Feature Prefix    | Example Column Name | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `z_`              | `z_0`, `z_1`, ...   | A latent space embedding from a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) Autoencoder or VAE. It is a compressed, 32-dimensional representation of the state of 12 high-frequency features (ETF prices, spreads, option IVs, etc.) over the last 60 seconds. These features are generated at a 200ms frequency but are aligned to the main interval grids for concatenation. |
| `fused_feat_`     | `fused_feat_0`      | A 96-dimensional feature vector resulting from a cross-attention mechanism. It fuses the `z_*` embeddings with the entire set of lower-frequency (e.g., 30s) engineered features (Categories I, II, III). It represents a learned combination of high-frequency and low-frequency information. |

### V. Target & Responder Features (Labels for ML)

These columns are the "answers" or labels that a machine learning model would be trained to predict. They are calculated based on future data relative to the current `ts_event`.

| Feature Name (Base)                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `target_next_window_return`                  | The log return of the primary underlying (SPY) over the next interval, adjusted for a small transaction cost estimate.                                                                                                                              |

| `target_next_rv_change_regr`                 | The raw change in `realized_vol_spy` in the next interval (Regression target). Formula: `RV_t+1 - RV_t`.                                                                                                                                              |
| `target_next_rv_change_class`                | A classification target (-1, 0, 1) based on whether `realized_vol_spy` increased, decreased, or stayed the same in the next interval.                                                                                                                |
| `target_next_qqq_spy_spread_change_regr`     | The raw change in the `log(QQQ) - log(SPY)` spread in the next interval (Regression target).                                                                                                                                                       |
| `target_next_qqq_spy_spread_change_class`    | A classification target (-1, 0, 1) for the change in the QQQ-SPY spread.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `target_next_spy_qqq_vxx_spread_change_regr` | The raw change in the `vol_hedge_spread` in the next interval (Regression target).                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `target_next_spy_qqq_vxx_spread_change_class` | A classification target (-1, 0, 1) for the change in the `vol_hedge_spread`.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `resp_mid_*` / `resp_vwap_*`                 | **Responder Features**. These are very short-term (e.g., 30s vs 5s) log returns of either mid-price or VWAP for SPY, QQQ, and VXX. They are calculated on a finer 1-second grid and are designed to be targets for high-frequency prediction models. |

## 4. Final Output Dataframe

The final output `features_{DATE}_{INTERVAL}s.parquet` file combines one set of features with the target labels. The choice of features is controlled by the `use_tcn_concatenation` flag in the configuration:

-   **If `True` (default):** The dataframe contains `ts_event`, all engineered features (Categories I, II, III), the `z_*` embeddings, and all target features (Category V). This is the "HF Concatenated" output.
-   **If `False`:** The dataframe contains `ts_event`, all engineered features (Categories I, II, III), the `fused_feat_*` features, and all target features (Category V). This is the "Attention-Fused" output.
